7259,64,I used this account a lot during the last month to manage my payments for my new place abroad. Seems that suddenly fees have increased? Shouldn't you instead reward your frequent customers instead of putting an additional fee suddenly?!

7261,64,I am confused about your fee structure and was disappointed to see a fee for my transfer.
